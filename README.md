# David Gallagher - Mobile Applications Assignment
The Purpose of this Project is to create a 2D Game in Unity. I am developing from a design document given to me by a colleague in this module.

This repository is developed as part of the Mobile Applications 3 module of 4th Year Software Development in GMIT.
